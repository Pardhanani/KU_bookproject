The materials in this repository are essentially a collection of lecture 
notes introducing certain topics of interest in statistical modeling, data 
science, and machine learning.  Our target audience is intellectually curious 
students and IT practitioners interested in understanding the reasoning and 
mathematical concepts underlying commonly used R and Python packages in these 
fields.  We have tried to keep our treatment of the mathematics intentionally light, 
so that the materials will be accessible to anyone with a math background 
similar to that of an undergraduate in a STEM discipline.  Although our central 
goal is to provide conceptual understanding, we have strived to do this through 
a heavily applications-centric perspective.
