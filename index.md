The materials in this repository are essentially a collection of lecture notes 
introducing certain topics of interest in statistical modeling, data science, and 
machine learning.  Our target audience is intellectually curious students and IT 
practitioners interested in understanding the reasoning and mathematical 
concepts underlying commonly used R and Python packages in these fields.  We have tried 
to keep our treatment of the mathematics intentionally light, so that the materials 
will be accessible to anyone with a math background similar to that of an 
undergraduate in a STEM discipline.

This project is "work in progress" (as of May 2025).  The topics currently covered include 
neural network models, and regression methods.  Although our central goal is to 
provide conceptual understanding, we have strived to do this through a heavily 
applications-centric perspective.  We acknowledge that certain parts of our treatment 
may involve a bit more mathematics than some readers might find comfortable.  In such cases, 
we recommend ignoring the mathematical details, and focusing on the big-picture objectives 
for which the mathematics is serving as a tool.
